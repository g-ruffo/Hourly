# Hourly - iOS App

The contractor's best friend has arrived! The Hourly app for iOS provides users that are self-employed with a quick and easy way to log working days for each client.
Simply add your start and end time along with your pay rate information and the app will calculate your weekly, monthly and yearly earning. 
In order to make invoicing a breeze, use the export feature which generates a CSV file breakdown for each employer. 
Utilizing iCloud, add photos, descriptions and locations to each working day and sync your records with all of your Apple devices.
